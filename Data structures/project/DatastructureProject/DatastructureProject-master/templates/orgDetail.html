    <p>Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming deals with lower level computer programmingâ€”machine or
        assembly language, and how these are used in the typical computer system. The book explains the operations of
        the computer at the machine language level. The text reviews basic computer operations, organization, and deals
        primarily with the MIX computer system. The book describes assembly language programming techniques, such as
        defining appropriate data structures, determining the information for input or output, and the flow of control
        within the program. The text explains basic I/O programming concepts, technique of interrupts, and an overlapped
        I/O. The text also describes the use of subroutines to reduce the number of codes that are repetitively written
        for the program. An assembler can translate a program from assembly language into a loader code for loading into
        the computer's memory for execution. A loader can be of several types such as absolute, relocatable, or a
        variation of the other two types. A linkage editor links various small segments into one large segment with an
        output format similar to an input format for easier program handling. The book also describes the use of other
        programming languages which can offer to the programmer the power of an assembly language by his using the
        syntax of a higher-level language. The book is intended as a textbook for a second course in computer
        programming, following the recommendations of the ACM Curriculum 68 for Course B2 "Computers and Programming.
